# decoix

Scrapes a URL and stands up a local copy for development.

`scrapeTarget` This is the URL for the page you want to duplicate
<br>
`scrapeToDirectory` This is the local folder for the website files

Set both of these arguments in the script, then run it

`node scraper.mjs`

Notes:

<ul>
  <li>Needs better file organization</li>
  <li>Creating too many extra files on root, Need to get <em>ESSENTIAL CSS ONLY</em></li>
</ul>
